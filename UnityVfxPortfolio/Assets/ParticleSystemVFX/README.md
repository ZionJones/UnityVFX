                                      Hello Welcome To My Unity Particle Systems Portfolio
This is where I keep all of the current particle effects that I have completed.

                                    1.) "Star Spiral" (In game "Pick Up" Object Effect)

![StarSpiral](https://github.com/ZionJones/UnityVFX/blob/master/UnityVfxPortfolio/images/StarSpiral.gif)

This is a simple particle system that is actually three diffrent particle systems working together.
The first is the center rotating blue/white stars effect is just multipilte particle spawning and fading into existance in short period of time. 
This movement is caused by particle moving across a velocity but no actually speed is given so they stay in a fixed point.
The second and third particcle effects are the same the intial spawn position is just inveresed.
In both case only one particle is made with a trail to move in a circular position.
My thought proccess for this effect  was for an in game power-up or skill the player could pick up.


                                       2.) Shock Ball

This particle system is seperated into multiple particle systems , however the most important one is the blue light effect in the center. 
By giving the 1000 glow particles that emit within a small space to create a glowing effect and after applying a noise variable i was abale to create liquid like movement to the radious to give of the illusion of plasma. The others are electric shock effects that fade in and out of existance at fixed point to give of a lightning effect.

                                          3.)Explosion

This particle system is pretty straight foward. It consits of only two particle systems the first is a shockwave like ring the expands outwards and gradually fades out of existance.The second particle system is a smoke effect the I gave a red to yellow color transformation threw it's lifetime as well as making the smoke rotate and expnad with in second to make it pop out like a explosion.

                                   Thank you for looking threw my portfolio
                                   
Thank you for taking the time to look threw my portoflio the effect I showed in this repository are subject to definitely change as I gain more expirence with creating Visual Effects. I will be adding more effects that I plan to complete and improve in the future.
