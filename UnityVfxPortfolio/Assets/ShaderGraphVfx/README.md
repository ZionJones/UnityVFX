This is Visual Effect is made with Unity Shader Graph System.

 I was going for a science fiction aesthetic with the barrier effect. As a game mechanic its supposed to go around the player like a bubble. Shader Graph use various amount of systems to create fexible effects. This visual effect works by taking a polygon texture and rotating around a game object of any size or shape.The game object is made transparent so that the texture rotating is the only thing shown.With the shader graph you can freely adjust the transperancy shape and even coloring of the effect with ease.
